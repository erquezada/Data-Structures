        "The Library Management System will allow you to manage books, customers, and borrowing operations. You'll implement functionalities such as adding new books, registering customers, handling book loans and returns, and generating reports. This project will help you understand how to choose and use appropriate data structures for different scenarios, and how these structures can work together in a larger application.\n",
