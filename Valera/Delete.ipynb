    "# Testing The Delete Node from CS 2302: Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "We are examining a Python program designed to delete a node from a data structure. It's important to clarify that this program is not our creation; instead, it's a tool we are testing. The code can be found in book \"CS 2302: Data Structures\" authored by Roman Lysecky, Frank Vahid, and Evan Olds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal in this test is to assess the functionality and effectiveness of this program in removing nodes from a data structure. Deleting nodes is a fundamental operation in data structures, and this program allows us to explore and understand how it's implemented in Python.\n",
