    "# Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science and programming, analyzing the time complexity of\n",
    "algorithms is crucial. It helps us understand how the algorithm's\n",
    "performance scales with different input sizes. Time complexity is\n",
    "typically expressed using Big O notation, which describes the upper\n",
    "bound of an algorithm's running time in relation to its input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Upper Bound**: Big O notation describes the upper bound or\n",
    "    worst-case scenario for the time complexity of an algorithm. It\n",
    "    indicates the maximum amount of time an algorithm will take as a\n",
    "    function of the input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Simplified Representation**: Big O notation simplifies the\n",
    "    analysis of an algorithm's performance by focusing on the dominant\n",
    "    factor that contributes most significantly to the running time as\n",
    "    the input size grows. It ignores constant factors and lower-order\n",
    "    terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Function of $n$**: The \"f(n)\" part in O(f(n)) represents a\n",
    "    mathematical function that describes the upper bound of the\n",
    "    algorithm's time complexity. This function is typically chosen to be\n",
    "    the most significant term that affects the running time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **O(1)**: If an algorithm has constant time complexity, it is\n",
    "    denoted as O(1). This means that the running time remains constant,\n",
    "    regardless of the input size. It's the most efficient time\n",
    "    complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **O($\\log n$)**: Logarithmic time complexity, denoted as\n",
    "    O($\\log n$), indicates that the running time grows logarithmically\n",
    "    with the input size. Algorithms with this complexity are very\n",
    "    efficient and scale well.\n",

    "relatively equal heights of the left and right subtrees, leading to\n",
    "improved search and insertion performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Binary Search Tree (BST):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   A BST is a tree-based data structure where each node has at most\n",
    "        two child nodes, often referred to as the \"lef\" and \"right\"\n",
    "        children.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   The nodes in a BST are organized in such a way that for any\n",
    "        given node:\n",
    "\n",
    "        -   All nodes in its left subtree have values less than or equal\n",
    "            to the node's value.\n",
    "\n",
    "        -   All nodes in its right subtree have values greater than the\n",
    "            node's value.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   This property ensures that data can be efficiently searched,\n",
    "        inserted, and deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Balanced BST:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   A balanced BST is a specific type of BST in which the height of\n",
    "        the tree is approximately balanced, meaning that the difference\n",
    "        in height between the left and right subtrees of any node is\n",
    "        limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   A balanced BST minimizes the height of the tree, which in turn\n",
    "        ensures that key operations like search, insertion, and deletion\n",
    "        have time complexities close to their best-case scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Balanced BSTs\n",
    "\n",
    "Balanced BSTs offer several benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Efficient Search:** In a balanced BST, the height of the tree is\n",
    "    logarithmic in the number of nodes, resulting in efficient search\n",
    "    operations with a time complexity of $O(\\log n)$, where $n$ is the\n",
    "    number of nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Efficient Insertion and Deletion:** Balanced BSTs maintain their\n",
    "    balanced structure during insertions and deletions. As a result,\n",
    "    these operations also have time complexities of $O(\\log n)$ on\n",
    "    average.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Ordered Traversal:** In-order traversal of a balanced BST produces\n",
    "    elements in sorted order, making it easy to obtain elements in\n",
    "    ascending or descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Self-Balancing Mechanisms:** Some balanced BSTs, like AVL trees\n",
    "    and Red-Black trees, have self-balancing mechanisms that\n",
    "    automatically adjust the tree's structure after insertions and\n",
    "    deletions to maintain balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Balanced BST Variants\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **AVL Tree:** An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree\n",
    "    where the height difference between the left and right subtrees of\n",
    "    any node (the \"balance factor\\\") is limited to at most 1. This\n",
    "    ensures a balanced structure and guarantees $O(\\log n)$ time\n",
    "    complexity for search, insertion, and deletion.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Red-Black Tree:** A Red-Black tree is another self-balancing BST\n",
    "    with a set of rules that maintain balance. It ensures that the\n",
    "    longest path from the root to any leaf node is no more than twice\n",
    "    the length of the shortest path. Red-Black trees also provide\n",
    "    $O(\\log n)$ time complexity for common operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Balanced Binary Search Trees are widely used in computer science and are\n",
    "the foundation for many efficient data storage and retrieval algorithms.\n",
    "Their ability to maintain a balanced structure ensures predictable and\n",
    "efficient performance, even as data is dynamically inserted and removed\n",
