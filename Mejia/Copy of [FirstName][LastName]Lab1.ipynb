In this project, you will develop a comprehensive, console-based application that simulates the operations of a library. This lab is designed to give you hands-on experience with various Python data structures including dictionaries, sets, lists, and tuples.\n","\n","The Library Management System will allow you to manage books, customers, and borrowing operations. You'll implement functionalities such as adding new books, registering customers, handling book loans and returns, and generating reports. This project will help you understand how to choose and use appropriate data structures for different scenarios, and how these structures can work together in a larger application.\n","\n","As you work through this lab, pay attention to how each data structure is used:\n","- Dictionaries for fast lookups and associations\n","- Sets for managing unique collections and efficient membership testing\n","- Lists for ordered data and queue-like operations\n","- Tuples for immutable grouped data"],"metadata":{"id":"qpBrPckozyHE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##Implementing the Classes\n","\n","### Author Class\n","1.
